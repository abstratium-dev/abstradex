# TODO

TODOs to be resolved by the developer, NOT THE LLM.

## Today

- search for more todo comments that need to be resolved
- replace DEMO_ERROR and similar error codes in ErrorCode.java with partner related error codes and actually use them.

## Tomorrow

- regenerate DATABASE.md after completing the database model


## Later (not yet necessary for initial release)
